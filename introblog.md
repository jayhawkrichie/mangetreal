# Man... Get Real!

## What is Man... Get Real!<br>
<p>Man...Get Real! is focused on tackling issues men face, but don't always want to talk about.

As men we have been marginalized by society through media portrayals of the male in television, movies, and commercials. The media has perpetrated the lie that men are not a vital part of a family unit.

As part of the marginalization has caused many men to revert to a cave man existance. Consider the creation of "The Man Cave".

Man... Get Real! hopes to provide a place where men can gather and rekindle the attitude and spirit men have lost over the previous decades. We will dig into each of these issues in depth through blog posts and podcast.</p>

## Who is Man... Get Real!'s audience<br>
<p> Our audience is men that are ready to take back their role in their families and society.
